## Be Informed About Your Bean: An App For Coffee Enthusiasts

1. A user can login with Facebook to view all current coffee selections.
2. Once logged in, user can check out all registered coffee shops. 
3. Within a coffee shop, there will be a list of all coffee beans they offer. 
4. Clicking on one of the beans, a user can view further information about the origin, processing and tasting notes of a coffee.
5. If a user is a roaster, user can click to register their coffee shop or add themselves to an existing shop.
6. When added, user will move into pending mode. Once admin approves user as a roaster, user will be notified via MMS and can begin to CRUD beans linked to their shop.
7. If a user is considered an admin, they have the ability to approve or delete users along with CRUD activities to beans to any coffee shop. 
8. All users have the ability to search the site, say they have a desired origin or flavor. The results displayed correspond to beans. The bean profile also points back to the coffee shop.
